\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
linearly interpolates between two points to create a ramp input to the controller 

This class generates ramp inputs for a classical postion P\+ID control loop and is intended to maintain that control loop\textquotesingle{}s linearity by limiting the size of the disturbances it is subjected to. First the time in microseconds it takes (at the current feed rate) for the laser to travel between the current and last setpoint are calculated. If the total travel period is less than the constant delta t for each ramp section no ramp is generated -\/ the pointer to an array containing the current setpoint and current feed rate are returned. If it is the case the total travel period exceeds the ramp section time differential, the number of ramp sections is calculated and array of length \# of ramp sections + 2 is generated. The extra two spots hold the
