6 Nov 2020 Created Project and this file in parallel with doxygen comments for future documentation 

7 Nov 2020 finished first version of motor driver, needs to be updated to accept more references since many inputs are predefined objects (pin names, other classes, etc. ) Also I need to figure out how to pass the instantiation of the hardware timer class to through this class (e.\+g. T\+I\+M1, T\+I\+M2, T\+I\+M3, etc) so that the timer can be changed as needed instead of being set in the header file as it is currently. 

10 Nov 2020 Got help from Dr. Ridgely for how to correctly pass timer objects into this class and was able to get it to the level of portability I desired. Motors work, though they are not particularly quiet due to being contained in what amounts to 3D printed echo chambers, but the slight increase in complexity for more capability than {\ttfamily analog\+Write()} was worth the effort. Especially given the added guarantee that pins are correctly being put in their alternate function modes. 

15 Nov 2020 Added brake method to try to do power and brake vs power and coast driving style for the motors. This was taken from sparkfun\textquotesingle{}s arduino Library for the \mbox{\hyperlink{classTB6612FNG}{T\+B6612\+F\+NG}} from\+: \href{https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_TB6612FNG_Arduino_Library/blob/master/src/SparkFun_TB6612.cpp}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/sparkfun/\+Spark\+Fun\+\_\+\+T\+B6612\+F\+N\+G\+\_\+\+Arduino\+\_\+\+Library/blob/master/src/\+Spark\+Fun\+\_\+\+T\+B6612.\+cpp}} However, I am not sure how to implement this method into our P\+ID controller... perhaps something that is watching for the error to drop to a certain threshold and then instead of settting the P\+WM singal to 0 and allowing the motor to coast, the short brake method is called. Also, given its name -\/ short brake -\/ in the truth table I am skeptical of how effective it would be in the first place
