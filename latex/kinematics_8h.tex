\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
the interface for the kinematics class that wil translate G\+C\+O\+DE inputs into a usable type for the control loop

Uses the appropriate kinematic equations to relate Gcode X,Y positions and F feedrate to values of the same type as the motor encoders output. This transformation significantly increases the ease of controlling the motors and only requires the proper transformation of the desired target positions, velocities, etc. from the Gcode. Core\+XY concepts used from Ilan E. Moyer -\/ one of the earlier authors of Core\+XY implementation and theory his website is available here\+: \href{https://corexy.com/theory.html}{\texttt{ https\+://corexy.\+com/theory.\+html}}
