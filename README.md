# ME507-desktop-laserEngraver

## Overview
This repository consists of the collected efforts of Niko Banks, Matthew Carlson, and Ethan Czuppa to develop an opensource, desktop, CoreXY laser engraver for the ME 507 class at Cal Poly SLO. As an open source design, this design builds on the work of others and is inteneded as an academic exercise to yield useful results. We would like to thank the follwing individuals and organizations for thier previous work on desktop laser engravers/cutters:
  * The developers of Laser DRW (an Inkscape plugin to output Gcode) from Scorch Works https://www.scorchworks.com/LaserDRW_extension/laserdrw_extension.html
  * Thomas and his design of a CoreXY laser Engraver on PrusaPrinters Beta https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/18771-corexy-laser-engraver
  * Instructables user nccwarp9 for his CoreXY laser Engraver design https://www.instructables.com/CoreXY-Laser-Engraver/
  * Many thanks to the other opensource developers that built the drivers, wrappers, classes, and packages to allow our code to run on the STM32 Nucleo L476RG 
  * Dr. Ridgely from the Cal Poly Mechanical Engineering Department for his ME 507 library support and excellence as a professor in the midst of a pandemic

## Disclaimer
This is an entirely opensource project developed by college students over the course of a single quarter and some change. While development is still ongoing, we are no where near completion, and even when we have finished the first full release the succesful use of this library and laser engraver - should you chose to construct - will vary from end user to end user. Additionally, we make no claims to have developed this entirely on our own. We leveraged large portions of others people's code, designs, and ideas and gave them credit for it. As such this repository, while it contains everything needed to build this hobby-level desktop laser engraver is neither intended for commercial use nor allowed to be included in a commercial product - see the license if you are unsure if your usage of this repository is permitted.
