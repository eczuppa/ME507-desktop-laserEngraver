# ME507-desktop-laserEngraver

# Overview
This repository consists of the collected efforts of Niko Banks, Matthew Carlson, and Ethan Czuppa to develop an opensource, desktop, CoreXY laser engraver for the ME 507 class at Cal Poly SLO. As an open source design, this design builds on the work of others and is inteneded as an academic exercise to yield useful results. We would like to thank the follwing individuals and organizations for thier previous work on desktop laser engravers/cutters:
